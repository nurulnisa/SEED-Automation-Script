## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration and How It Works

The **SEED Automation Script** is fully configurable and can be adjusted through the settings file or command-line arguments:

- **Task Type**: Select which tasks you want to automate, such as gathering resources, farming, crafting, or questing.
- **Speed Control**: Modify the speed at which tasks are performed to suit your needs (e.g., faster resource gathering or slower for more precision).
- **Hotkeys**: Assign hotkeys to start, stop, or pause the automation as needed.
- **Custom Scripts**: Add custom tasks or modify existing ones to fit your specific needs (requires basic scripting knowledge).

### How it works:
1. The script monitors the game window for specific triggers or in-game events.
2. It simulates keypresses, mouse movements, and other in-game actions to perform the automated tasks.
3. The script adjusts its behavior based on the configuration settings you‚Äôve set in the script or through the settings interface.
